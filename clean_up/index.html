        <p>I am a web developer that enjoys working on projects that help further public communication and the exchange of information. Over the past year I have done an internship with WeDidIt as a part of the where my role was "Software and Web Developer Intern". My discovery of programming happened during high school in a junior year Java class and I've been hooked ever since. I'm currently a student at Hunter College studying Computer Science. I am a part of the CUNY Tech Prep program where I am working to solidify my skills as a full stack developer. I believe that it is important to know what goes into a product all the way from UI design to the database and plan to become proficient in all fields throughout my career. With my goals, I always aim high and truly believe that any feat is attainable through proper planning and commitment. Besides programming, I love meeting new people and learning more about other industries so feel free to contact me through direct message or email. </p>
